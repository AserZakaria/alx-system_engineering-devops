# Application Outage Postmortem

## Issue Summary

- **Duration:** Start Time: May 7, 2024, 3:00 PM (GMT) End Time: May 7, 2024, 8:00 PM (GMT)
- **Impact:** The application experienced a complete outage, affecting all users globally for 5 hours.
- **Root Cause:** A race condition in the caching layer caused memory exhaustion, leading to system-wide crashes.

## Timeline

- **Detection:** May 7, 2024, 3:15 PM (GMT) - Monitoring system triggered alerts for unusually high memory usage and server crashes.
- **Actions Taken:** 
  - 3:20 PM - Investigated server logs and identified recurring errors related to memory allocation.
  - 3:45 PM - Suspected a possible memory leak and initiated memory profiling.
  - 4:30 PM - Discovered a race condition in the caching layer during code review.
- **Misleading Paths:** 
  - Initially focused on memory leaks due to recurring errors in server logs.
  - Assumed hardware failure due to widespread server crashes.
  - Overlooked the possibility of software bugs until later in the investigation.
- **Escalation:** 
  - 5:00 PM - Incident escalated to the development team for further analysis and resolution.
- **Resolution:** 
  - 7:30 PM - Identified and fixed the race condition in the caching layer.
  - 8:00 PM - Application service restored, and memory usage stabilized.

## Root Cause and Resolution

- **Root Cause:** A race condition in the caching layer caused excessive memory consumption, leading to system-wide crashes.
- **Resolution:** The race condition was identified and fixed in the codebase, preventing further memory exhaustion and system crashes.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Implement rigorous code reviews and testing procedures to catch race conditions and other concurrency issues.
  - Enhance monitoring to detect abnormal memory usage and performance degradation.
- **Tasks:**
  - Conduct a comprehensive review of the caching layer to identify and address any additional race conditions or performance bottlenecks.
  - Implement automated memory profiling and analysis to detect memory-related issues early in the development lifecycle.
  - Enhance documentation and knowledge sharing to improve awareness of potential concurrency issues among the development team.
